input sequence: 01001010001

a) output sequence with old state table
present state: a e d h h b c f e c e
input:         0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
next state:    e d h h b c f e c e d
output:        0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

b) output sequence with new state table
present state: a b d d d b c f b c b
input:         0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
next state:    b d d d b c f b c b d
output:        0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
