a) Q(t+1) = JQ' + K'Q
when Q = 0
Q(t+1) = J.1 + K'.0 = J

when Q = 1
Q(t+1) = J.0 + K'.1 = K'

b) Flip flop changes state on positive clock edge
when J = 0, K = 0 at positive edge of clock, state of flip flop remains in same state 
as it was before clock tick.

when J = 0, K = 1 at positive edge of clock, state of flip flop is set to zero state.

when J = 1, K = 0 at positive edge of clock, state of flip flop is set to one state.

when J = 1, K = 1 at positive edge of clock, state of flip flop is inverted as it was 
before clock tick.
