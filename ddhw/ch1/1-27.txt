52 playing cards can be represented in normal binary code with 6 bits. But some bit combination are unused in this scheme.
Let msb's select the suit of card (e.g. diamond, hears, clubs, spade encoded as 00, 01, 10 ,11). The remaining 4 bits for the number of
card (e.g 0001-ace to 1001-9, 1010-Jack, 1011-Queen, 1100-King   )

BCD, 2421 or excess-3 code would require 8 bits.
