(253)

a)  253 / 2 = 1
    126 / 2 = 0
     63 / 2 = 1
     31 / 2 = 1
     15 / 2 = 1
      7 / 2 = 1
      3 / 2 = 1
      1 / 2 = 1
      = 1111 1101

b)  253 / 16 = 13 (D)
     15 / 16 = 15 (F)
     = FD
     = 1111 1101

Second method seem to be faster since it required fewer iteration. Once number converted in hex its binary conversion is
straight forward.
