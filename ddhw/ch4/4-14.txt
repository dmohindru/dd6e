Gate    Prop_Delay (ns)
------------------
xor     8
and     4
or      4

Propogation Delay of Carry Lookahead Genertor unit = 4 + 4 = 8ns

Therefore total propogation delay = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24ns

-------------------------------------------------------
extra work: 
compute propogation delay of 4 bit ripple carry adder using full adder (fig 4-8, 4-9)

propogation delay of 1 bit full adder: 8 + 8 + 4 = 20ns
propogation delay of 4 bit full adder: 20 * 4 = 80ns
