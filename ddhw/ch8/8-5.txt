ASM Chart is used to describe the behaviour of digital system, partation in data path and control unit.

Element of ASM
1. State box
2. Decision box
3. Conditional output box

It is similar to state diagram as both diagram describe conditions under which state of digital system is changed.

It was difficult to describe complex digital system with conventional state diagram. So design was partationed into contol unit
and data unit. An ASM chart describes intraction between these units. And also guides in developing circuit for contol unit.

Three steps to form an ASM Chart:
1. Form an ASM Chart showing only the states of the controller, decision boxes and the names of input signals that causes state
transitions.

2. Convert the ASM chart into as ASMD chart by annotating the edges of the ASM chart to indicate the concurrent register operation
of the datapath unit(i.e., register operatons that are concurrent with a state transitions,) and

3. Modifiy the ASMD chart to identify the control signals that are generated by the controller and that cause the indicated 
operations in the datapath unit.
