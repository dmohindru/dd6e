Total address lines to be used = log2(16 X 1024) = 14 Lines
Number of and gates required in straight forward configuration = 2E14 = 16384
For coincident decoding
a) Size of each decoder = 7X128. Number of and gates used = 128X2 = 256.

b) address (6000)10 = (0101110 1110000)2
input on X =  0101110 =  46
input on Y =  1110000 = 112
