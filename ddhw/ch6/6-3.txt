Serial transfer is when data is transfered 1 bit at each clock pusle. Where are as parallel transfer is
when data is transfered n-bit at each clock pulse.

Serial data can be converted into parallel data using a universal shift register where data is first entered into register
serial and then taken out in parallel.

Similarly parallel data can be converted into Serial data using universal shift register where data is first entered into 
register parallel and then taken out in serial 1 bit at each clock pulse.
