Truth table for control (C) and parallel load (L) input for clocked input (C_in) using nand gate.

C   L   |   C_in
--------------
0   0   |   1
0   1   |   1
1   0   |   1
1   1   |   0

register updates it contents only when clock control and parallel load control in high. Assume flip flop are trigerred on 
negetive edge of clock.

Because this circuit has a gated input to clock, which would introduce a propogation delay to clock input of flip flop. Hence
circuit might have synchronosing issue with clock.
More over if load signal is asynchoronous then it might posses following problems.
1. If gated clock arrives in the setup interval of clock input of flip flop, causing metastability.
2. Load signal might truncate the clock width, hindering the proper function of clocked circuit.
